# CYK-Parser
Simple CYK Parse program that accepts the grammar rules in Chomsky Normal Form and calculates most probable parse of an input sentence.

Grammar is stored as a dictionary and most probable parse is stored in a graph. 

This program is based on an algorithm by Ernest Davis and is implemented in python 3.6.
